# Spring Boot PostgreSQL REST API Demo
A startup [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) REST API that connects to PostgreSQL.

This is largely based on ["Quickest Way to Create REST API in Java with Spring Boot"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of1IcjpGNNg&t=1s), but makes use of a PostgreSQL database.

Has automatic/default endpoints for CRUD on /employees.
